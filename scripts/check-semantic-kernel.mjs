// The kernel is a ceiling, not a floor: a shorter specification is always an
// improvement, a longer one is the regression this gate exists to catch.
//
// The budget is normally slack, and then one day it is not. Adding
// LANG.SOURCE.FRAME took the file to the ceiling exactly, so the next clause
// added here fails this check on arrival. That is the gate working: the answer
// is to shorten or merge an existing clause, which is the question "does the
// specification need this, or does it already say it elsewhere?" asked at the
// only moment anyone will actually ask it.
//
// Two answers that look like fixes are not. Raising the number right after
// hitting it retires the brake; and reflowing prose to put more words on fewer
// lines keeps the count down while the specification grows, which is the thing
// being measured. Raising it deliberately, when the language genuinely has more
// to say, is a different act and a fine one — it just wants to be a decision
// rather than a reflex.
//
// `headroom` below is reported on every green run, so how close the file is
// sitting is visible without reading this comment.
//
// Raised to 404 for LANG.DICTIONARY.ACYCLIC: the User dictionary's reference
// graph became acyclic by rule (no definition may name itself, directly or
// through a chain of other User words), retiring the guarded-tail-recursion
// feature and its own clause text in LANG.SOURCE.FRAME. Net new content, not
// reflowed old content — the language now has something it did not have
// before (every evaluation is structurally finite, not merely
// resource-bounded) — so this is the deliberate raise the comment above asks
// for, not a reflex.
//
// Raised to 408 for LANG.RECORDS.STRUCTURE: the vocabulary-100 work order
// (docs/dev/vocabulary-100-work-order-2026-09.md §2.3) admitted a seventh
// value domain, the keyed correspondence, and a domain needs its own clause —
// its structure, its identity, its containment rule — where the earlier
// phases of that work order fit into existing clauses. Four lines: the
// heading, the paragraph, and their separators. Net new content again.
