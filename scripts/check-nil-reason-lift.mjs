// Reason-preservation gate for the element-wise lift (LANG.COLLECTIONS.LIFT:
// "each lane preserves the exactness, truth, NIL, and ERROR distinctions of
// the scalar law").
//
// The scalar law is passthrough with the reason intact — `-1 SQRT 1 ADD` is still
// `NIL(domainMiss)`. This checks the lifted law says the same thing, lane
// for lane: a program that puts a reasoned NIL into a collection and then runs
// element-wise Words over it must still report that reason, and must still
// report an absence at all.
//
// Both halves are needed, and neither sees the other's failure:
//
//   - The *reason* check catches a lane whose absence survived but whose
//     reason did not. A lane law that rebuilds a collection from numbers
//     only can drop the reason on the way: the lane comes back reasonless —
//     which reads as `nil:literal`, "a NIL the program wrote rather than
//     computed" (spec/outcomes.json), for a NIL the program computed and
//     never wrote.
//   - The *count* check catches a lane that stopped being an absence. A
//     dense tensor holds numbers only (LANG.VALUES.EXACT), so a lift that
//     read a NIL lane as some number — a pair over zero, say — would compute
//     with it and answer an observable `0/0` scalar. There is no reason to
//     compare there because there is no NIL left to carry one, so the reason
//     check passes such a lane in silence.
//
// Every program here is executed; nothing is string-matched. Some programs
// legitimately raise — a chain that pairs the producer's vector with one its
// shape cannot pair with is a `shapeMismatch` (LANG.COLLECTIONS.LIFT) — and
// which ones is worked out from the shapes below, not observed: a program
// that raises where its shapes pair is a failure, and so is one that answers
// where they do not. Skipping every raise instead let a lift that wrongly
// refused a pairing (a one-element Vector over irrational lanes) pass here.
// A program that does not answer at all is always a failure.
