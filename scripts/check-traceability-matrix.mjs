// docs/quality/TRACEABILITY_MATRIX.md is the requirement -> implementation ->
// verification link QUALITY_POLICY.md §2 requires and RELEASE_VERIFICATION_
// CHECKLIST.md asks to be gap-free. Seven source files cite it by path.
//
// For most of the repository's history it did not exist: every one of those
// citations was dangling, and nothing said so. Writing it down fixes that once.
// This gate is what keeps it fixed, because a matrix drifts in two directions
// and both had already happened by the time it was written:
//
//   - a suite is deleted and its rows stay, leaving the matrix claiming
//     coverage that is gone (AQ-VER-003-A, -003-B and -007-E were removed with
//     their subjects, and no check noticed);
//   - a suite is added with a fresh ID and no row, so the matrix silently
//     stops being the whole picture.
//
// So: every ID in the source must be in the matrix, every live ID and path in
// the matrix must be in the tree, and an ID the matrix calls retired must not
// still be in the source. This is a name-reachability check, the same shape as
// check-docs-dev-drift.mjs — it cannot tell whether a row *describes* its suite
// correctly, only whether both ends still exist.
