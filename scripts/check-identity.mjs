// Gate for spec/identity.json, the canonical identity law.
//
// The law's whole content is that a procedure which cannot decide identity says
// so, rather than answering `different`. The way that goes wrong on paper is a
// level quietly claiming to decide more than it does, so this gate checks the
// shape of each level's claim against itself:
//
//   - a level that decides `different` must be able to reach it, and a level
//     that cannot must not list it;
//   - a level that is not total must name how `unknown` arrives — a reason id
//     spec/outcomes.json declares, or an explicit soundness/incompleteness pair
//     saying which direction it can answer in;
//   - a level that claims totality must not also claim incompleteness.
//
// The behavioural half — that the invariances hold, that the incompleteness
// witness really does denote one function under two identities, and that
// definitions which observably disagree never share an identity — is in
// rust/src/identity_laws.rs, which runs these same witnesses against the engine.
//
// Usage:
//   node scripts/check-identity.mjs
