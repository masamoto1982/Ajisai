// That numbering belongs to `SPECIFICATION.md`, a Markdown specification of
// seventeen numbered sections deleted in 3f21400c ("Migrate SPECIFICATION and
// README from Markdown to HTML"). Every citation to it has been dangling ever
// since, and nothing noticed: 241 of them accumulated across 120 files, of
// which 34 named subsections (§8.7, §4.8, §12.3, §2.5, §7.1.1, §7.15, §14.4)
// that never existed in that document either.
//
// The current specification numbers nothing. It publishes stable `LANG.*`
// clause IDs precisely so a citation survives the document being reorganized —
// which is what LANG.CONFORMANCE.CHANGE asks of a derived surface. So a
// citation is either a `LANG.*` clause ID, or it is prose that stands on its
// own; a section number is neither.
//
// This gate is the part that makes the fix stick. An earlier pass (710e8168)
// repointed the stale §-citations it found in `docs/dev/` and added no gate,
// so the far larger population in `rust/src`, `rust/tests` and `src/` stayed
// invisible for another six weeks.
