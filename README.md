# Ajisai

Ajisai is a stack-based, vector-oriented dataflow language whose true user is AI. Numbers are never rounded, dividing by zero never stops a program, and truth is three-valued, as in SQL. There is nowhere to write a type; rigor lives in the machine-readable contracts the Words carry.

```
[ 1 2 3 ] [ 1 0 2 ] DIV    # [ 1/1 1/0 3/2 ]
```

## What Ajisai can do

- **Exact arithmetic.** Integers and decimals alike are exact rationals, and `SQRT` keeps its results as algebraic irrationals. There is no choosing between float, double and decimal. `0.1 0.2 ADD 0.3 EQ` is `TRUE`, and a sum or a product is one value in whatever order its operands are taken, points over zero included, so reordering or regrouping a `FOLD` never changes its answer.
- **Division that never stops.** Dividing by zero answers a point over zero, `1/0` or `0/0`, which is a number. In a vector computation only the element divided by zero is affected.
- **Vector computation without loops.** Arithmetic Words lift over vectors automatically, and `SELECT` branches element by element. Collections are processed with `MAP`, `FILTER` and `FOLD`.
- **Failure with a reason.** An operation that cannot produce a value answers a `NIL` carrying its reason, and that `NIL` flows on downstream. Evaluation stops only when the operation or the shape of its input is itself wrong, or when a program exceeds the limits the host can support.
- **Checking before running.** Every Word carries a contract stating what it takes and how many, whether it is pure, and what it returns when it cannot produce a value. User-defined Words are checked against these contracts before anything runs.
- **Use from AI.** Through the [MCP server](tools/mcp-server/README.md#install-and-connect), an AI can run Ajisai code and check its contracts.

## Why Ajisai

I had given up partway on every programming language I tried, and I wanted to build the tool itself rather than something with it. **Forth** showed me that a language is allowed to be that small. I still wanted the rigor of types without writing them, so Ajisai carries that rigor in contracts on the Words instead of annotations on values.

**AI** made the design practical. With AI writing the code alongside me, a language needs no syntactic sugar for human convenience; it can hold nothing but strict machine-readable rules and plain dataflow.

The arithmetic is not new: it is Carlström's *wheel of fractions* over the integers. What Ajisai adds is that every contract says, before anything runs, whether the code can reach a point over zero (`field=closed` or `field=leaving`).

I began the work in June, in Japan's rainy season. Watching the rain, I pictured fractions poured into a vessel called a Vector: one substance inside, never rounded, and rich ripples on its surface. The hydrangea — *ajisai* in Japanese — takes its scientific name, *Hydrangea*, from the Greek for "water vessel".

## Sister language

[Arare](https://github.com/masamoto1982/Arare) is Ajisai's counterpart, an antithesis of equal standing. Ajisai fixes the value — it never rounds — and counts what that costs, stopping a run at the ceiling of its work meter. Arare fixes the cost — every value is one machine word of a width known before it runs — and counts what that loses, as an error budget checked before anything runs. The two share their syntax, their three-valued truth, their total division and every Word they both have, with one name and one meaning that neither changes alone; each checks the other on the programs they share (`tests/sister/`).
