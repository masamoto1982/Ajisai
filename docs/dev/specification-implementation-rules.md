# AI-first Implementation Rules

How this repository is written. Engineering discipline for contributors —
not part of the language.

## Authority

- **Non-canonical.** LANG.AUTHORITY.SOURCES places `docs/dev/` outside the
  normative set. Nothing here defines Ajisai semantics or constrains a
  conforming implementation.
- Until #1652 this content was inlined into `SPECIFICATION.html` as a
  numbered section 12, where it rendered identically to the normative
  clauses two paragraphs after the one saying `docs/dev/` defines nothing.
  The specification's own table of contents never listed it. It now lives
  only here, which is where the authority clause already said it belonged.
- The first Mandatory rule below is machine-enforced by
  `scripts/check-file-size-budget.mjs` against
  `docs/quality/file-size-baseline.json`; the rest are read, not gated.

## Mandatory

- Prefer explicit, structurally searchable function and module names.
- Keep newly created Rust source files, and files that are substantially
  rewritten, at or under 500 lines. Existing over-budget files are recorded
  as a baseline (`docs/quality/file-size-baseline.json`) and, as a goal,
  must not be changed in ways that further increase their line count.
- Keep control flow shallow and phase-separated.
- Separate semantic changes from structural cleanup in change management.
- Maintain single canonical implementations; do not allow dual-mode drift.
  What has to be single is the *knowledge* — one rule, one number, one output
  format — not every block of text that resembles another. See **The DRY
  criterion** below for how the two are told apart.
- Source code comments are allowed when they clarify intent, invariants,
  traceability, or non-obvious behavior. When source code is changed, nearby
  comments must be reviewed and updated so they remain accurate. Comments
  that merely restate obvious code should be avoided.

## Advisory

- Extract a helper when two places encode the same decision. Duplicated
  control scaffolding is a reason to look, never a reason on its own to
  unify: this line used to read "prefer small helper extraction for
  duplicated control scaffolding", which measures shape, and shape is not
  what DRY is about.
- Prefer deterministic, low-ambiguity error classification.
- Prefer mechanically enforceable tests over narrative documentation.

## The DRY criterion

The principle's own statement is about knowledge: *every piece of knowledge
must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a
system*. It is not a rule against text that repeats. Two blocks that read
alike while encoding two independent decisions are not a violation, and
merging them couples the decisions — the next change to one arrives as a
parameter threaded through the other.

Before unifying two places, or before leaving a second copy standing, ask:

1. **If one changes, must the other change in the same commit, for the same
   reason?** Yes — one piece of knowledge, and it needs one representation.
   No — two pieces of knowledge that happen to agree today; leave them apart.
2. **Can a reader tell which copy is authoritative?** If not, the copies are
   already drifting, whether or not they currently disagree.
3. **What is the second copy for?** A projection generated from the source
   (`spec/*.json` → registry, docs, Specification) is not a second
   representation. A hand-kept restatement is.

Both directions have a cost and neither is free:

- A restated *number, rule or output format* drifts silently. It is why the
  host-side doc comments went on saying the default step budget was 100,000
  after the constant was rederived. Name the constant; do not restate its
  value.
- A shared helper over two unrelated decisions **couples** them. The MCP
  server's `executionSteps: 100_000` is the same literal as the interpreter's
  retired default and must stay its own: it is that host's policy, not a copy
  of the language's.

Where a second representation is genuinely unavoidable, it is allowed with a
mechanical gate that fails on disagreement, and a comment saying why it
exists. `src/gui/core-word-name.ts` restates the canonical-name grammar from
`spec/words.schema.json` because the GUI cannot read the spec at runtime, and
`core-word-name.test.ts` asserts the predicate against `spec/words.json`
itself. Deliberate non-sharing is recorded the same way:
`rust/src/interpreter/word_outcome_vocabulary.rs` opens by saying it is
deliberately independent of `word_contract.rs` rather than leaving a reader to
assume the overlap was missed.
