# Third-Party Licenses

Ajisai itself is licensed under the MIT License (see [`LICENSE`](LICENSE)).

This document lists the third-party software that Ajisai **redistributes** —
i.e. components that ship inside a built artifact (the web bundle, the
self-hosted `public/vendor/` assets, the WebAssembly module, or the Tauri
desktop binary). Build-time-only tools that are **not** redistributed are
listed separately at the end.

Almost all redistributed dependencies are under permissive licenses (MIT,
Apache-2.0, BSD, ISC, Zlib, Unicode) and impose no source-disclosure
obligation on Ajisai. The one exception is the desktop-only `serialport`
crate (**MPL-2.0**, a *file-level* weak copyleft) — see the note in the
desktop section below; it does not affect Ajisai's own source. There are no
strong-copyleft (GPL/LGPL) dependencies.

## Web / front-end (shipped in the web bundle and `public/vendor/`)

### KaTeX 0.17.0 — MIT License

Self-hosted at [`public/vendor/katex/`](public/vendor/katex/) and also bundled
into the web build via `import katex from 'katex'`
(`src/gui/output-display-renderer.ts`). This includes `katex.min.js`,
`katex.min.css`, `contrib/auto-render.min.js`, and the `KaTeX_*.woff2` webfonts.

A copy also ships next to the assets at
[`public/vendor/katex/LICENSE`](public/vendor/katex/LICENSE).

### coi-serviceworker technique — MIT License

[`public/coi-serviceworker.js`](public/coi-serviceworker.js) is an original,
header-only reimplementation of the cross-origin-isolation service-worker
technique popularised by Guido Zuidhof's
[`coi-serviceworker`](https://github.com/gzuidhof/coi-serviceworker) (MIT).
It is not a copy of the upstream source; the attribution is retained in the
file's header comment.

## Desktop application (shipped in the Tauri binary)

The desktop build links the following crates. Each is dual-licensed
**MIT OR Apache-2.0** unless noted; the canonical license texts are those
published with each crate on <https://crates.io> / its source repository.

| Component | License (SPDX) |
| --- | --- |
| `tauri`, `tauri-build` | MIT OR Apache-2.0 |
| `tauri-plugin-fs` | MIT OR Apache-2.0 |
| `tauri-plugin-dialog` | MIT OR Apache-2.0 |
| `tauri-plugin-store` | MIT OR Apache-2.0 |
| `serialport` | MPL-2.0 ⚠ see note |
| `@tauri-apps/api`, `@tauri-apps/plugin-*` (JS) | MIT OR Apache-2.0 |

> **Note on `serialport`:** the `serialport` crate is licensed under
> **MPL-2.0**, a *file-level* copyleft. MPL-2.0 only requires that
> modifications to the crate's *own* source files be shared; it imposes **no**
> obligation on Ajisai's own source, and unmodified redistribution inside the
> desktop binary is permitted provided the MPL text and source availability are
> preserved. Source: <https://github.com/serialport/serialport-rs>. If you
> prefer to avoid MPL entirely, the serial feature can be gated out of the
> desktop build.

## Build-time only (NOT redistributed)

These are `devDependencies` / build tooling. Their own code is not included in
any shipped artifact, so they impose no attribution obligation on Ajisai's
distributed output. Listed here for completeness only.
