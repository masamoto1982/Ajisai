// stdio server's main thread by construction — the parent never imports the
// WASM module or awaits it synchronously (see wasm-worker.js).
//
// One fresh WebAssembly instance per call, mirroring the native backend's
// one-process-per-call model. The Worker itself is kept and reused, because
// starting a Worker is what a call used to spend its time on (50-100 ms,
// against well under a millisecond for the operation); what the isolation
// actually rests on is the instance. Each call's instance has its own linear
// memory and its own copy of the wasm-bindgen glue's module-level state, and
// it has run nothing but the fixed warm-up below, exactly as the Worker used
// to. The compiled module is shared: it is code, not state.
//
// The response-size ceiling is checked here, on the JSON *text* the WASM entry
// point returns — the same bytes the native backend's `execFile` measures on
// stdout, so both backends reject at the same threshold on the same units.
// Checking it here also means an oversized envelope is never structured-cloned
// across the thread boundary.
