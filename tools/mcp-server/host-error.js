// Ajisai's own outcomes — a value, a reason-carrying `NIL`, a language `ERROR`
// — are all *successful* tool calls carrying structured diagnosis. What was
// left unstructured was the other half: a missing backend, an exhausted
// budget, a timeout, a malformed backend response. Those arrived as prose, so
// a caller wanting to tell "retry in a moment" from "this will never work"
// had to match on English substrings — which the server's own self-test was
// already doing, in the one place a brittle dependency is most visible.
//
// Every host failure now carries a stable `code`, a `retryable` flag, and a
// message written for a model rather than for an operator. Internal detail —
// absolute paths, environment-variable names, spawn diagnostics — stays on
// the server's stderr, where the person who can act on it is looking.
