// A stdio MCP server is silent when it is healthy and silent when it is
// wedged, and from a terminal the two are indistinguishable: the operator sees
// a process that started and a client that offers no tools, with nothing
// saying whether the fault is the Node version, a corrupt packaged asset, a
// missing WASM bundle or the client's own configuration. `--doctor` is the
// difference. It runs the same asset validation, backend selection and real
// computation the server runs, against the same installed copy, and answers
// with an exit code.
//
// Everything here is reached only when `index.js` was given arguments, and
// never after a transport is open, so the stdout MCP frames travel over is
// never written to by a diagnostic.
