/**
 * No prompt may show the retired block syntax.
 *
 * The `static-check` and `contract-inference` prompts asked, in both locales,
 * about `{ [ 1 ] + } 'INC' DEF` — the retired block form — while their own
 * `arguments.source` carried the correct `[ [ 1 ] + ] 'INC' DEF`. The fixtures
 * therefore passed: the corpus scores the tool call, and nothing read the
 * prompt. But this corpus is the text a model is shown, and what a model is
 * shown is what it imitates. A corpus for an AI-first language is the last
 * place a retired form should survive.
 *
 * This list used to be read out of the packaged manifest's `retired_form`
 * entries, so that retiring another form extended the gate for free. There are
 * no such entries any more: `{`, `}` and a bare `|` were freed into ordinary
 * name characters along with `(` and `)`, and the manifest carries only live
 * forms (`docs/dev/source-character-liberation-2026-09.md`). The gate's reason
 * is untouched by that — `{ [ 1 ] + } 'INC' DEF` still does not define
 * anything, because `{` resolves to no Word — so what changed is only which
 * layer refuses it, the dictionary rather than the lexer. The pair is named
 * here because it is now a closed historical fact rather than a registry that
 * can grow: code blocks and vectors were unified onto `[` and `]`, and nothing
 * is queued to be retired behind them.
 *
 * Two deliberate narrowings, each of which a first draft of this gate got
 * wrong:
 *
 * - The block delimiters only. `(` and `)` are ordinary punctuation in both
 *   prompt languages, so forbidding them rejects correct prose — and they are
 *   ordinary name characters in Ajisai now besides.
 * - Only cases that expect an Ajisai tool call. A negative case exists to check
 *   that a question about *another* language does not reach an Ajisai tool, so
 *   `irrelevant-debug` shows a C-style `for` loop on purpose. Code that is not
 *   claiming to be Ajisai is not a lexical claim about Ajisai.
 *
 * Scope is the characters and not the whole fragment for the same reason:
 * prompts legitimately carry English prose like "the vector [1, 2]", which is
 * mathematical notation, so a tokenize-everything rule would reject them.
