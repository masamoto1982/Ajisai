// The tool descriptions are the entry surface, so they are checked like one.
//
// With `tool_choice: auto` these four strings are the only text a caller reads
// before its first call — the quickstart and the vocabulary are resources it
// has to *decide* to fetch, and the measured baseline says it does not. That
// makes a description that omits part of the product indistinguishable, from
// the caller's side, from a product that lacks it: of 118 prompts, 21 produced
// no call at all, twelve of those asking for collection work the description
// never mentioned.
//
// So two properties are pinned here, both cheap and both checkable without a
// model:
//
//   * every Word family the registry declares is represented, so a family
//     added later cannot silently go unannounced;
//   * every Word name the descriptions mention actually exists, so the entry
//     surface never does to a caller what the caller did to us — send it after
//     a name that was never there.
