//! Phase 2 — syntax / desugar soundness as executable laws.
//!
//! Companion to `algebraic_laws.rs`, encoding
//! `docs/dev/ajisai-formalization-expansion-roadmap.md` Phase 2: the surface
//! desugaring of LANG.SOURCE.DESUGAR / LANG.SOURCE.NORMALIZE is *observationally transparent*:
//! word names are case-normalized (LANG.SOURCE.NORMALIZE), and a symbol the
//! language has not allocated reaches the dictionary as an ordinary name. Each law is the compressed form
//! of infinitely many tokenizer conformance cases: if desugaring were not
//! `⟦desugar(s)⟧ = ⟦s⟧`, some generated pair would render differently.
//!
//! Observation is structured, not a display-string fragment: laws compare stack
//! renders plus semantic axes (including NIL/UNKNOWN absence diagnosis), effect
//! trace, and error category.
