//! Property-based string / text laws (Phase 9, SPEC §7.6).
//!
//! Encodes the algebraic content of
//! `docs/dev/ajisai-mathematical-formalization.md` §9-octies I.2 (Phase 9):
//! a string literal `'abc'` is a **String**, one of the six disjoint domains of
//! LANG.VALUES.DISJOINT, and the empty String is one of its values. The text
//! words (`STR`/`NUM`/`CHARS`/`JOIN`/`TRIM`/`TOKENIZE`) are Core Words.
//!
//! Observation is firewall-clean: text is read through the pure `render` (a
//! String renders `'…'` from its domain, with no role consulted); predicates
//! through `render` (`TRUE`/`FALSE`). Every law was probe-confirmed first (roadmap §1.2-(T)).
