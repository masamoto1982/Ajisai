//! A resource an agent plans against has to report the number it is judged by.
//!
//! `runtimeMetrics.executionSteps` was read from a `RuntimeMetrics` field that
//! no code ever wrote, sitting beside the `Interpreter::execution_step_count`
//! every limit check increments. Two counters for one fact, and the reported
//! one was the one that was always zero — so a 21,000-step fold and an empty
//! program described their work identically, and the ceiling an agent was
//! supposed to budget against could not be observed at all.
