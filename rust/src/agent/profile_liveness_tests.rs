//! A declared ceiling that another ceiling always pre-empts is a claim, not a
//! control.
//!
//! The three internal-cost ceilings are not independent dials. Building a large
//! *exact* value requires work — not as an implementation artifact but as what
//! exactness means, since every digit and every term was actually computed — so
//! each size ceiling has a minimum work cost to reach it:
//!
//! ```text
//! work_to_reach(size ceiling) < max_numeric_work
//! ```
//!
//! A profile that violates this declares a ceiling nothing can ever hit. Its
//! `mcp.limits` entry still refuses the program, but under the wrong name, and
//! the name is what an agent repairs from: "you exceeded the work budget" and
//! "stop multiplying surds like that" are different instructions.
//!
//! `max_algebraic_terms` was 4,096 under the MCP profile and violated it. The
//! doubling that would first exceed 4,096 terms charges 16,799,744 units
//! against a 10,000,000 budget, so `numericWork` answered every time and the
//! term ceiling had never fired in its life. That went unnoticed through
//! three rounds of external review because nothing checked it. This is what
//! checks it.
//!
//! Until 2026-08-14 this module checked one profile: `LOCAL_AGENT_RUNTIME_LIMITS`
//! (MCP / `ajisai agent`). The playground / `ajisai run` default was silently
//! assumed to be fine because it was strictly more generous — but "more
//! generous" is not "live": the same day's re-derivation of
//! `DEFAULT_MAX_NUMERIC_WORK` (`docs/dev/host-profile-derivation-handoff.md`
//! §4) shrank the playground's work budget enough that its own
//! `max_algebraic_terms` (100,000 at the time) stopped being reachable —
//! exactly the failure mode this module exists to catch, just on the other
//! profile. Every liveness property below is now asserted for **both**
//! profiles, with each profile supplying its own witness sizes (the two
//! profiles' ceilings differ by construction, so the source that crosses one
//! does not cross the other).
