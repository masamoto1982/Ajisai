//! What a report keeps when its stack is too large to send.
//!
//! An error report carries two different things, and they are not equally
//! important. The **diagnosis** is the answer: why the program stopped, which
//! ceiling it met, what to do next. The **stack** is residual state: whatever
//! the program happened to be holding when it stopped. Serializing the residue
//! in full and letting the whole envelope exceed a host's response ceiling
//! trades the answer for the residue, which is backwards.
//!
//! It was not hypothetical. `1 21000 RANGE 1 [ MUL ] FOLD` is refused by the
//! work meter with `numericWork of 10000573 exceeds the limit of 10000000` —
//! precisely the diagnosis an agent needs — but the failing stack holds a
//! 21,000-element vector and an 81,649-digit partial product, so the envelope
//! came to 5,773,682 bytes of which 5,571,973 were the stack. Against the MCP
//! adapter's 1 MiB `responseBytes` ceiling that became
//! `hostError: responseTooLarge`, and the agent was told its *answer* was too
//! big rather than that it had exceeded the *work budget* — which points it at
//! shrinking output when the fix is to compute less. `numericWork` could not be
//! reclassified from `injectedLimit` to `boundary` for the same reason: a
//! control whose diagnosis does not survive the wire is not observable.
//!
//! So an error report elides the value payload of the slots it cannot afford,
//! and says that it did. A **successful** result under a host budget does the
//! same, for the opposite reason: a success *is* its stack, and a host that
//! refused the whole result as `responseTooLarge` told the caller nothing of
//! what was on it — not that a 100,000-element intermediate had been left
//! behind, not that the two small values beside it were fine. Elided, the
//! slots that fit arrive whole and the one that does not arrives as a record
//! of what it was, which is what lets the caller fix the program. Three rules
//! make either case honest:
//!
//! 1. **Values are dropped, never reasons.** `diagnosis`, `aiDiagnostic`,
//!    `errorFlowTrace`, `message` and `output` are never touched.
//! 2. **Every slot stays in place.** An elided slot keeps its index, `type`,
//!    `semantics` (less an algebraic value's `exactTerms`), and gains an
//!    `elided` record naming what was dropped. Positions stay meaningful, so a
//!    diagnosis that points at stack depth still points at the same thing.
//! 3. **The reason says which budget.** `errorStackBudget` is the fixed
//!    [`MAX_ERROR_STACK_BYTES`] every error report applies;
//!    `valueStackBudget` is the host-chosen one a success was sent under
//!    (`api::ComputeOptions::stack_budget_bytes`), and a host that sets none
//!    never sees it.
//!
//! This bounds what is *sent*, not what is built; the generative ceiling
//! (`maxMaterializedElements`) is what bounds the latter. And it is a
//! best-effort preservation, not a guarantee of delivery: a host whose response
//! ceiling is below the budget still refuses the result, and `responseBytes`
//! remains the hard gate.
