//! The Coreword registry: what the runtime knows about each Core Word.
//!
//! The contract half of that — stack arity, NIL policy, purity, determinism —
//! is **not** written here. It is read from `kernel::generated`, projected from
//! `spec/words.json`, and this module joins it with the runtime-local facts
//! derived from it (the flow-mass contract the analyzers read). It adds no
//! classification of its own: a label the registry does not declare is one a
//! reader cannot check against the specification.
//!
//! Two of the vocabularies that used to be declared in this file were narrower
//! than the canonical ones and mislabelled Words as a result: the hand-written
//! `NilPolicy` had 5 of the specification's 7 values, and `WordPurity` had 3 of
//! its 4 with `conditional` inexpressible, so every higher-order Word was
//! recorded as `pure`. Determinism was a `bool` where the specification
//! distinguishes `deterministic` / `stateRelative` / `hostRelative`. All three
//! now come from the generated enums, where a value the canon admits is a
//! variant by construction.
