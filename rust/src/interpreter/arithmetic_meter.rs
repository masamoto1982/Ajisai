//! Where arithmetic is charged and bounded — the work meter's boundary.
//!
//! This lives beside the arithmetic dispatch rather than inside it, because it
//! is a property *of* the dispatch and not of any route the dispatch chooses.
//! It used to be neither: two of the six routes out of
//! `arithmetic::apply_exact_arithmetic_schema` charged, both reachable only
//! when both operands were scalar-shaped, and the other four were free. So
//! `2 3 MUL` was priced and `[ 2 ] 3 MUL` was not, and `algebraicTerms` was a
//! ceiling a vector literal turned off. Which route runs is an optimization
//! decision, unobservable by LANG.AUTHORITY.FREEDOM; a safety control priced
//! per route made it observable, which is the one thing a limit must never do.
//!
//! The charge is taken at the entry, before a route is chosen and before either
//! operand is consumed, so a refusal leaves the stack as the program left it.
//! The size check is taken per route, on the result, before the operands go —
//! it bounds what an operation *leaves behind* so the operand feeding the next
//! one is still a sane size.
