//! Resolution laws for `crate::interpreter::resolve_word`.
//!
//! LANG.DICTIONARY.RESOLUTION: "The dictionary has two tiers. **Core** holds
//! the 57 canonical Words and is sealed: a Core name cannot be redefined or
//! deleted. **User** holds definitions made by `DEF`. Resolution is a
//! deterministic function of the normalized name and the current dictionary,
//! and User never shadows Core." And: "Those two tiers are the whole
//! dictionary: a name resolves in Core or in User."
//!
//! This file used to test a different dictionary. It had named user
//! dictionaries addressed by `DICT@WORD`, `USER@DICT@WORD` and
//! `DICT@USER@DICT@WORD`; a bare name fell through three stages, and a name
//! held by several dictionaries was collapsed by content identity or reported
//! ambiguous. None of it was reachable from the language — no Word changes the
//! active dictionary, so every `DEF` wrote to the same one — and the clause
//! says there are two tiers. The laws below are what is left once there are.
