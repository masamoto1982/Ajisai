//! Specification-driven NIL contract conformance.
//!
//! # Why this suite exists
//!
//! `nil_conformance_tests` derives what it checks from the *implementation's
//! own* `nil_policy` label: it enumerates the registry, selects the Words the
//! implementation calls `Passthrough`, and probes those. That coupling has a
//! blind spot which is not incidental but structural — **the label decides what
//! gets tested, so a wrong label removes the Word from its own test.** A Word
//! mislabelled `RejectsNil` is never probed for passthrough, and a Word
//! mislabelled `Passthrough` in an uncovered category is never probed at all.
//!
//! An audit of every Word against `spec/words.json` found six Words whose
//! runtime behavior contradicts the policy *both* sources declare, every one of
//! them invisible to the existing suite for exactly that reason.
//!
//! This suite closes the loop by taking its obligations from the **canonical**
//! contract in the generated registry (projected from `spec/words.json`) rather
//! than from any hand-written label. Every fixed-arity Word whose declared
//! policy makes a NIL operand observable is probed, and the outcome is compared
//! against what the specification says must happen.
//!
//! # The divergence baseline
//!
//! `KNOWN_DIVERGENCES` records the Words whose runtime does not yet honor the
//! declared policy, mirroring the `docs/quality/file-size-baseline.json`
//! pattern already used in this repository: the list is a ratchet, not a
//! permission. A Word not on the list must conform, so no *new* divergence can
//! be introduced; entries are removed as the executors are corrected. The test
//! also fails if a listed Word starts conforming, so the list cannot go stale.
//!
//! **The list is now empty.** Every audited Word honors its declared policy,
//! because the dispatch guard decides both directions from the declaration
//! instead of leaving each executor to decide for itself. The machinery stays
//! so that a regression has to be admitted explicitly rather than committed
//! quietly.
