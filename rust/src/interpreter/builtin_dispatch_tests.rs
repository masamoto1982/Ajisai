//! A Core Word is dispatched from the registry entry its definition carries,
//! not from a second lookup by name.
//!
//! `execute_word_core` resolves a name to an `Arc<WordDefinition>` and
//! then, for a Core Word, used to find the *same* Word again by string:
//! `execute_builtin` re-canonicalized the name and `generated_word` scanned the
//! 65-entry registry comparing names. That ran once per element — 220,000
//! `memcmp` calls, 6.25% of the instructions of a 20,000-element `[ ABS ] MAP`
//! — to re-answer what resolution had just answered.
//!
//! `WordDefinition::generated` holds the entry instead, because
//! `builtins::register` has it in hand when it builds the definition. These pin
//! what has to be true for that to be sound: the entry is present for every
//! Core Word and is the *right* one, a User Word has none, the two routes run
//! the same Word the same way (LANG.AUTHORITY.FREEDOM — the choice of route is
//! unobservable), and the name route still answers for the cases that reach it.
