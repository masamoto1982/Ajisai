//! The fused route's Words against their contracts (`fusion_contract`).
//!
//! Which Words may run on plain values inside a block is read from
//! spec/words.json. These hold the hand-written side to it: no op, kernel or
//! quickened `Kind` exists for a Word the contract does not admit, and every
//! Word it admits has one, or is listed here with the reason it has none.
//! Whether each one answers as the interpreted route does is held by the
//! route-equality suites (`fused_block_tests`, `quickened_tests`), whose
//! generators draw the kernel Words too.
