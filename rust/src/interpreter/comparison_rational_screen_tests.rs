//! Two rational operands compare as the rationals they are.
//!
//! `three_way_compare`, `compare_scalar_pair` and `scalar_pair_eq` each ended in
//! a `Fraction` comparison whenever both operands were rational — their
//! `(Some, Some)` arm — but reached it by building an `ExactReal` from each
//! operand first, and `extract_exact_real_for_comparison` clones the `Fraction`
//! out of the `Value` to do that. Two clones and two constructions per
//! comparison, to arrive at the two `Fraction`s the operands already held; and
//! `ABS` pays it twice per element, since `abs_scalar` asks for the sign by
//! comparing against a freshly built zero.
//!
//! `rational_pair` borrows them instead. That is only sound if the round trip it
//! skips is the identity — `ExactReal::from_fraction(f).as_rational() == Some(f)`
//! — and only *complete* if nothing but a plain rational takes the screen. Both
//! are pinned here, the first directly and the second by leaving every other
//! shape to answer through the route that can: an algebraic pair decides exactly
//! (√8 vs √2+√2), and a computable pair may honestly fail to
//! (LANG.VALUES.EXACT).
