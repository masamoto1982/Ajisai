//! What `UNIQUE` and `TALLY` answer, and in what representation.
//!
//! Both run one hash-keyed scan. Over a flat pure-integer dense buffer that scan
//! keys the `i64` numerator column instead of a boxed `Value` per lane: every
//! such lane has denominator 1, so numerator equality *is* value equality, and
//! `Fraction`'s cross-multiplying `eq` agrees lane for lane. Everything else
//! keeps the boxed scan, and the tests below pin both halves — the fast one for
//! its answers and its ordering, the slow one for what it must not lose.
//!
//! The pricing half lives in `collection_meter_tests`, whose subject is a charge
//! that must not turn on a representation decision.
