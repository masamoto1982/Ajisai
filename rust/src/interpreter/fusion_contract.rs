//! Which Words may run inside a fused block, read from their contracts, and
//! the plain law each runs there.
//!
//! A fused walk (`fused_block`) holds only plain values — rationals and
//! Booleans — and must reproduce everything the interpreted walk would have
//! done. A Word can take part when its contract (spec/words.json, projected in
//! `kernel::generated`) says so:
//!
//! - it is pure and deterministic and declares no effects;
//! - it takes a fixed number of operands, none of them a `control` operand
//!   (a block, a name, a message), and answers exactly one value;
//! - every operand's declared domains include a scalar or a Boolean, and
//!   every result's are scalars, Booleans, or `any` — a value the Word picks
//!   from its operands, as `SELECT` does (`stack.domains`,
//!   LANG.VALUES.DISJOINT);
//! - it costs exactly one execution step whatever its operands
//!   (`cost.steps`), as every op of a fused block is charged.
//!
//! The other cost axes are upper bounds over every operand, containers
//! included (`SELECT` declares linear collection work for the masks it lifts
//! over), so they do not say what a plain call costs. That is the law's own
//! report, and the route-equality suites compare it with the interpreted
//! route's, collection work included.
//!
//! The contract says a Word *may* run on plain values; what it does there is
//! the Word's own law. Most admitted Words have a hand-written op of their
//! own in every tier (`fused_block_lower::word_op`). Any other admitted Word
//! runs through [`PlainKernel`]: the scalar law its dispatch calls, applied
//! to plain operands, with the charges that dispatch makes for it. A kernel
//! that meets anything the law would not answer with a plain value — an
//! ERROR, a NIL, an irrational — declines, and the walk falls back to the
//! interpreted one, which reports it.
//!
//! `fusion_contract_tests` holds the three sides together: every Word with a
//! hand-written op or a kernel is admitted by its contract; every admitted
//! Word has one, or is listed with the reason it has none; and each kernel
//! answers as its dispatch does.
