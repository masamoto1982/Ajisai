//! `spec/words.json` declares, per Word, what it does with each operand
//! (`stack.operands`, LANG.FAILURE.PASSTHROUGH): a `data` operand is read, so
//! an absent one makes the result that absence; an `element` is carried
//! without being read, so a NIL there is an ordinary value; a `control`
//! operand — a block, a name, a message — cannot be absent, so a NIL there is
//! malformed use; a `truth` operand reads NIL as UNKNOWN. This is the one
//! place that reads those roles, so no executor can quietly disagree with the
//! canon, and two Words that treat an operand alike treat a NIL there alike.
