//! Arithmetic on rationals whose numerator and denominator each fit a
//! machine word: the `Small` form `Fraction` stores them in, held as an
//! `(i64, i64)` pair in lowest terms with a positive denominator.
//!
//! `Fraction`'s own small path dispatches on its enum, widens to `i128` and
//! re-normalises through `create_from_i128` on every operation. The kernels
//! that hold many such values unboxed (`dense_kernels`, the fused walk's
//! `fused_block_rat`) use these instead: Henrici's sum and cross-cancelled
//! product and quotient, with gcds and quotients in machine words and only
//! the final products widened. Each answers `None` when its result no longer
//! fits a pair (or, for `div`, on a zero divisor), for the caller to hand the
//! work to `Fraction`. A rational's lowest-terms form with a positive
//! denominator is unique, so these agree with `Fraction` wherever they
//! answer; `fraction_gcd_tests` holds them to it.
