//! One-line repairs appended to a diagnosis message.
//!
//! The error object a host reads is fixed (`category`, `resource`, `word`,
//! `line`, `column` — docs/dev/agent-cli-output-contract.md); a hint lives only
//! in the human-readable message, which LANG.OBSERVATION.DIAGNOSIS lets evolve.
//! No program behavior and no protocol field depends on it.
//!
//! Two questions are answered here:
//!
//! * A name that resolves to nothing: the line of current Ajisai that does
//!   what it meant — a retired Word's phrase from `spec/retired-words.json`,
//!   or an idiom from another language from [`FOREIGN_IDIOMS`] — and failing
//!   both, the Core names within a typo's distance of it.
//! * A Core Word called with too few operands or with an operand of the wrong
//!   domain: the Word's own one-line example (`documentation.syntax` in
//!   `spec/words.json`), preceded where a Word is commonly mistaken for
//!   another by a pointer to the right one ([`MISTAKEN_DOMAIN`]). A Word
//!   refused for its operands' shapes gets a pointer only where the refusal
//!   is a known misreading of what the Word does ([`MISTAKEN_SHAPE`]).
//!
//! Every example here is run by `diagnostic_hint_tests`, so a hint is
//! verified Ajisai rather than prose that resembles it.
