//! The canonical lexical grammar, held against the implementation.
//!
//! `spec/grammar.json` is read here as data, and every claim it makes that the
//! tokenizer can answer is run rather than inspected. This is the half of the
//! grammar's proof that lives in the language of record; the other half is
//! `scripts/lib/reference-lexer.mjs`, which executes the same file in JS, and
//! `scripts/check-grammar.mjs`, which runs the same witnesses through it.
//! Because both sides consume one file and one shared corpus, the grammar
//! cannot quietly become a description of something the implementation no
//! longer does.
//!
//! What a failure here means: the grammar and the tokenizer disagree. Neither
//! is automatically right. `spec/grammar.json` is canonical for what Ajisai
//! source *is*, so a deliberate language change updates it first and the
//! tokenizer follows; an accidental divergence is a tokenizer bug.
