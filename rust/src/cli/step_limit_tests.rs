//! Native tests for `ajisai run --step-limit <N>`: the host-configurable
//! execution step budget (water level, SPECIFICATION.html §5.3). The budget
//! is a runtime safety control, not language semantics, so these tests only
//! assert *whether* `ExecutionLimitExceeded` is raised — raising the budget
//! lets a legitimately large `FOLD` run to completion, lowering it sandboxes
//! even a short program — plus the CLI usage-error contract (exit 2 for zero
//! / non-numeric values). Deliberately not part of the conformance suite:
//! conformance must not depend on any budget value.
